Gucci gang
Yuh, Lil Pump
Gucci gang
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring no
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
My lean cost more than your rent, it do
Your momma still live in a tent
Still slanging dope in the 'jects
Me and my grandma take meds
None of this shit be new to me, no
Fucking my teacher, call it 'tutory
Bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs
Fuck your airline, fuck your company fuck it
Bitch your breath smell like some cigarettes cigarettes
I'd rather fuck a bitch from the projects
They kicked me out the plane off a Percocet
Now Lil Pump flying private jet
Everybody scream, "Fuck WestJet!"
Lil Pump still sell that meth
Hundred on my wrist sipping on Tech
Fuck a lil bitch, make her pussy wet what?
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
Spend three racks on a new chain
My bitch love do cocaine
I fuck a bitch, I forgot her name
I can't buy no bitch no wedding ring no
Rather go and buy Balmains
Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang
